# Cursor 1.3 Series Late July Updates - Real Performance Improvements and Disappointing Aspects from Actual Use

Last week Cursor dropped update after update, all the way up to version 1.3.4. I'm someone who gets excited about AI coding tools and always applies updates immediately, and this round was pretty impressive. Here's my honest take after actually using it for a week in real projects.

## A Week of Update Storms

From July 23rd to 29th, it was truly a breathless series of updates. With new versions coming out every other day, I initially thought "Is there some major problem?" But it turned out to be major feature additions followed by rapid bug fixes.

- **Version 1.3.0** (July 23rd) - Major update
- **Version 1.3.1** (July 24th) - Emergency patch
- **Version 1.3.2** (July 25th) - Performance tuning
- **Version 1.3.3** (July 26th) - Stabilization work
- **Version 1.3.4** (July 29th) - Final patch

## Noticeable Speed Improvements - Is It Really Faster?

### Tab Completion Definitely Got Faster

Officially they claim **100ms reduction**, and I can genuinely feel the difference in real use. Especially when writing React components, the speed at which autocomplete suggestions appear has noticeably improved. Previously, there were moments where I'd think "Huh? Is it not working?" and wait briefly, but now it feels almost instantaneous.

### Real Effects of 30% TTFT Reduction

They say memory management improvements led to **30% faster time to first token**, and this really shows when requesting more complex code. For example, when I ask "refactor this function to TypeScript," I used to wait a second or two, but now it starts almost immediately.

## New Features - Merge Conflict Resolution Was Impressive

### Automatic Git Merge Conflict Resolution Attempts

This was genuinely surprising. During a team project when conflicts arose, the **Agent asked "Would you like me to resolve the conflicts?"** It's not perfect, but it handles simple conflicts quite well. Complex logic conflicts still need human review though.

### Slack Integration Seems Useful for Teams

Being able to **run the Agent with `@Cursor` mentions** looks promising for team environments. We haven't fully tested it on our team yet, but it seems like it would be useful for code reviews and quick Q&A sessions.

## Disappointing Aspects - Stability Issues in Particular

### Problems After the 1.3.2 Update

After updating to 1.3.2 on July 25th, I was really frustrated. While working on a large project, Cursor suddenly froze several times. Looking at community forums, I wasn't the only one experiencing this. Fortunately it improved a lot in 1.3.3, but having your tool freeze during important work is really stressful.

### Limitations with Large Projects

The projects I mainly work on are pretty substantial, and I notice response times degrading as file counts increase. I'm using `.cursorignore` files to exclude unnecessary files, but fundamental improvements seem needed.

## Impressions from Real Work Usage

After applying it to actual projects for a week, I was generally satisfied. The faster autocomplete speed for routine coding tasks is genuinely noticeable. However, I think there's still room for improvement on the stability front.

### Recommended Usage Patterns

From experience, here's what works best:

1. **Backup Essential**: Always Git commit before important work
2. **Optimization Settings**: `.cursorignore` optimization is crucial for large projects
3. **Quick Response**: If things get weirdly slow, restart immediately (this is still the most reliable fix)

## Future Expectations

Seeing how rapidly the Cursor team is making improvements shows they're really serious about the AI coding tools space. If they can just solve the stability issues, this could become a truly powerful tool.

Personally, I'm hoping the next update brings multi-file editing capabilities or smarter context management features. It's already plenty useful, but adding features that let you see the bigger picture would be a real game changer.
